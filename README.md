#Lemmigs 3 : Dragon Witcher

A project made with C++ and OpenGL for the subject Videogames in FIB-UPC.
On this project, we created a 2d game in a group of 2 people based on the famous game Lemmings. We used two inspirations for the lore and the abilities of the lemmings: dragon ball and The witcher.
We created three levels and eight skills for the lemmings, an interface (UI) with a clock, a double-speed button and a functional menu. The lemmings have two different skins.
